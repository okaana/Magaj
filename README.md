Magaj - A game for memory (This is just the barebone call it version 0.1)

This game is developed for people who want to increase their memory power in terms of speed and accuracy with remembrance.
It was built by keeping eldearly in mind but later realised that this can be used by people who have weak memory due to lack of training their memory.
